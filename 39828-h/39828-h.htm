<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>


<p>In his ably written introduction to the first edition
of this work, Mr. John Malone makes the following
statement: "It may be set down as a safe
rule of judgment as to dramatic quality that the
plays which were printed were fit for no more than
the use to which an indulgent Providence and the
Dunlap Society have dedicated them&mdash;to serve as
examples of the good-will and sympathy with which
a few great and good men in the days of our country's
fiery trial held out their helping hands to the
gentle art of drama."</p>

<p>This statement, with a possible exception or
two, is in the main correct. Few of the plays which
are here catalogued have survived because of their
literary excellence. We, however, must not look at
the contents of this book from this view-point, but
rather from the historical. Poorly written as many
of the plays may be, they still possess to the student
of American history an interest which far exceeds
that of every other class of writing, the purely historical
excepted. The <i>first</i> play written by a resident
of what is now the United States was <i>Androboros</i>
(the Man-Hater) written by Robert Hunter, Colonial
Governor of New York, assisted by Lewis Morris.
This play, or rather dramatic satire, was written to
ridicule sundry residents of that colony, principally
Dr. Vesey and several members of Trinity Church.
This play, which was issued in 1714, was not followed
by another dramatic production, as far as
known, until <i>The Suspected Daughter</i>, a farce by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
"T. T.," was printed at Boston in 1751. Who "T.
T." was is not known, nor can I trace a copy of the
play. Little of importance came to light previous
to the Revolution, but that event, stirring as it was,
seems to have been a stimulant to native ambition,
and a number of dramatic productions were written
and printed. Among these may be mentioned <i>The
Battle of Bunker Hill</i> and <i>The Death of Montgomery</i>
by Brackenridge, then a schoolmaster; <i>The
Adulateur</i> and <i>The Group</i> by Mercy Warren, afterwards
well known as one of the foremost dames of
the colonies; and several others, some from the Royalist
side, as Sewell's <i>Cure for the Spleen</i> and an
anonymous production, <i>The Battle of Long Island</i>.</p>

<p>The second war with England was also celebrated
by our early playwrights, as was the war
with Tripoli.</p>

<p>The dramatic history of no country would be
complete which did not celebrate the deeds and warlike
exploits of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the
American dramatist was not slow in recognizing the
many-sided character of the North American Indian.
His wars, his fluent oratory, his virtues, are all told,
the best of these efforts being embodied in Stone's
<i>Metamora</i>, made famous by the acting of Edwin
Forrest.</p>

<p>But all of the dramatic productions which were
written prior to 1830 did not relate to America, and
a glance over the list will show many plays which
take for their groundwork the French Revolution,
the Napoleonic Wars, the Russian Empire and its
people, while Love, that mysterious something which
lays its finger upon all whether we will or no, is
found, as in our fiction, in nearly all of them. What
the dramatist, poet, and novelist would do without
the help of the fickle goddess is an unsolvable problem.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>As will be seen by a glance at the contents of this
volume, few of the plays were acted, nor were many
of them intended for public entertainment. A large
number were written to serve a purpose&mdash;political or
otherwise&mdash;and when that had been attained, were
forgotten, even by their authors.</p>

<p>They show, however, what was and could be
accomplished in this way, at a time when the average
citizen had little time for aught but earnest, sober
thought.</p>

<p>When looked at from this view-point we must
really wonder that as much remains as has been discovered.
Can any country besides ours show a better
result&mdash;at least for quantity, if not for quality?</p>

<p>Among the interesting facts which will be discovered
by a perusal of this list is that a number of
the writers of early American plays were men who
achieved success in other callings. Thus we find
among those who found time to interest themselves
in the drama and the production of plays, the names
of Judge H. H. Brackenridge, Charles Brockden
Browne, the first American novelist, Edward Hitchcock,
President of Amherst and foremost among the
scientists of his era, David Humphreys, Revolutionary
soldier and diplomat, John Neal, the friend of
Poe, Jas. G. Percival, the poet, Jas. K. Paulding, coworker
with Irving, Royall Tyler, and Samuel
Woodworth, author of <i>The Old Oaken Bucket</i>.</p>

<p>This edition is issued at the solicitation of a
number of collectors and librarians, who were unable
to obtain a copy of the first edition, which was
issued for members of The Dunlap Society in 1900. I
have endeavored to make this list as complete as
possible, and it has been to me a labor of the greatest
interest. Nothing that I have ever attempted in bibliographical
work has given me more pleasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous corrections will be found by comparison
with the earlier edition, and upwards of sixty
new titles are included, discovered since the issue of
the earlier volume.</p>

<p>Errors will, of course, be discovered, but I ask
indulgence in those who find them, for as all who are
interested will readily admit, no bibliographical work
was ever perfect.</p>

<p>Probably the most complete collection of early
American plays, at this writing in the hands of a
private collector, is that owned by Evert Jansen
Wendell, Esq., of New York. Several of the titles
contained in this volume would be unknown to me
at this time but for the kindness of Mr. Wendell, who
has given me the opportunity to examine his collection.
Another good collection is owned by the
Brown University Library, Providence, R. I.</p>

as a novelist of the first class, and was the first
American to take that place in English literature.
His first writings were published in Philadelphia periodicals,

<i>The Monthly Magazine</i> and <i>American Review</i>
(1779-1799), and edited <i>The Literary Magazine</i> and

Dunlap and Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, a member of
the "Friendly Club" in New York, and one of Dunlap's
most devoted friends. He was one of the first
to advocate (in 1803) the purchase of Louisiana from
France; and in a series of articles published in that
year strongly urged the progressive territorial extension
of the Union. He was married in November,
1804, to Miss Elizabeth Linn, daughter of Rev. Dr.
William Linn of New York, and thus became the
brother-in-law of John Blair Linn, between whom
and himself a lifelong attachment of affection existed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo Da Ponte Da Ceneda</span>; born in Venice,
Italy, in 1748; died in New York, August 17, 1838,
was an ardent poet and dramatist, and was attached
to the Court Theatre at Vienna in 1784,
where several of his librettos were produced with
success. He came to New York about 1809, and
established himself as a teacher of languages, finally
becoming Professor of Italian Literature in Columbia
College. He was a very popular figure in New
York society, and dearly loved by his compatriots, to
whom he gave an affectionate welcome upon their
coming to his new home. He was an intimate associate
of Mozart, Metastasio, and Joseph II. of
Austria. Upon the arrival of the first Italian opera
of Signor Garcia and his illustrious daughter in New
York, they found that Da Ponte had made their way
to triumph easy. He was, in fact, the foster-father
of Italian opera in America.</p>

February 19, 1766, and died in New York, September
28, 1839. He came to New York in 1777 and
commenced the study of painting, for which he had
an early inclination. In 1784 he went to London,
where for three years he worked under Benjamin
West. On his return he became interested in the
drama, and wrote his first play. He soon after
became closely identified with the theatre, and appeared
on the stage. In 1796 he became manager
of the John Street Theatre, and, soon after, sole
manager of the New Park Theatre. In 1805 he retired
from the management a bankrupt, and devoted
himself to his original profession of painting. In
1814 he received the appointment of Assistant Paymaster
General of the New York State Militia. In
1817 he again took up the brush, and exhibited some
of his large paintings in most of the cities of the
United States. He was founder and vice-president of
the National Academy of Design. He wrote <i>The
Life of George Frederick Cooke</i> and <i>A History of the
Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in America</i>&mdash;a
most valuable work. He also wrote a number
of other works on different subjects.</p>

the son of Thomas Hopkinson. Francis was educated

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the making of the United States. To enumerate his
works and honors would transcend the scope of this
book. He was a member of the Continental Congress
in 1776, signed the Declaration of Independence, and
was the first head of the treasury department of the
new government. The first powerful satire of the British
in Revolution, <i>The Battle of the Kegs</i>, was from
his pen. A ripe scholar and a prolific writer of prose
and verse in both humorous and earnest methods,
skilled in music and in polite conversation, he was
one of the most brilliant of the group of early jurists
and writers of our country. He was United States
District Judge of Pennsylvania at the time of his
death. The authorship of the two anonymous college
dialogues cited below is positively given to him in the
Brinley Catalogue (New York, March, 1880), in view
of which, and of the not less important fact that
Thomas Hopkinson died in 1751, I think, notwithstanding
the statement made by a contemporary
newspaper, that the Dialogue of the 1776 commencement
was his work. Of that occasion Sanderson's
<i>Biography of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence</i>
says in the memoir of Francis Hopkinson:
"Among the records of a public commencement of
that institution [the College of Philadelphia], held
on the twentieth of May, 1766, the board of trustees,
comprising the governor, chief justice and most distinguished
men of the province, passed the following
resolution: 'After the business of the commencement
was finished, it was resolved that as Francis Hopkinson
(who was the first scholar entered in this seminary
at its opening and likewise one of the first who

<p><span class="smcap">John Neal</span>, born in Portland, Me., August 25,
1793, died there June 21, 1876. He was entirely self-educated,
and, after a few years of business occupation
in Baltimore, he was admitted to the Maryland
Bar in 1819. He had already begun to have some
popularity as a writer of stories, and in 1823 he was
led to make a trip to England, in consequence of the
popularity which his novels had acquired there.
While in England he wrote several articles on America
for the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and enjoyed an intimacy
with British men of letters, particularly Jeremy
Bentham. On his return in 1828 he established <i>The
Yankee</i>, and was an active journalist for half a
century. To his energy is attributed the agitation of
woman's suffrage, and the establishment of gymnasiums.
He was Poe's first encourager. His <i>Recollections</i>
were published in 1869.</p>

a volume of travels. He was at one time appointed
sheriff of the county. An estimate of his character

"He told the best story, rounded the best sentence,
and wrote the best play of all his contemporaries....
As editor, critic, and author, he was looked up to

<p><span class="smcap">Susanna Rowson</span>, born in Portsmouth, England,
in 1762, died in Boston, Mass., March 2, 1824. She
was an only daughter of Lieutenant William Haswell,
of the British Navy, who was, at the beginning
of the Revolution, attached to the revenue service,
and resided at Nantucket, near Boston. His property
was confiscated by the Continental authorities;
and himself and family removed on parole to
Hingham in 1775, and in 1777 to Abington. A cartel
was finally arranged by which Lieutenant
Haswell was exchanged and sent back to England
with his family. Miss Haswell took employment as
a governess in early life, and was greatly devoted to
literature. She married William Rowson, a musician
in one of the bands of the household troops. About
the time of her marriage she wrote and published a
novel entitled <i>Victoria</i>, which she dedicated to the
Duchess of Devonshire, who introduced her to the
Prince of Wales. She was enabled, by this acquaintance,
to obtain a pension for her father. On account
of the financial embarrassment of her husband, they
went on the stage in 1792, in Edinburgh. In 1793
they came to America, and first appeared in Annapolis,
Maryland. Thence they went to the theatre in
Philadelphia, and, after a season there, became members
of the Federal Street Theatre in Boston. Mrs.
Rowson, who had, in 1790, published in England the
celebrated novel <i>Charlotte Temple</i>, had continued
writing, and the extraordinary popularity of her
story of the unfortunate English girl made it easy for
her to follow the cultivation of letters. She retired
from the stage in 1797, and established a school for
young ladies, which remained, during her life-time, the
most select and popular in New England. Her last
appearance was in May, 1797, in her own comedy,

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Wright</span>, born in Dundee, Scotland, September
6, 1795, died in Cincinnati, O., December 14,
1852. She became, early in life, imbued with French
liberalism, and was an admiring friend of Lafayette.
She first came to the United States in 1818, and was
introduced in literary circles here by Joseph Rodman
Drake. After a time spent in Paris she came again to
the United States in 1825, and purchased 2400 acres
of land in Tennessee, at Neshoba (now Memphis).
Here she established a colony of freed slaves. The
State authorities compelled the relinquishment of the
scheme as contrary to the law of the commonwealth,
and the land, which was held for her in trust by
Lafayette, was reconveyed to her. The negroes were
sent to Hayti, and Miss Wright spent three years in
lecturing on slavery and social topics in the United
States, especially upon woman suffrage, of which she
was the first considerable advocate. She went again
to France, where she married Monsieur d'Arnsmont,
with whom, however, she lived but a short time,
returning finally to Cincinnati, Ohio, where she made
her final home.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by David Starner, Katie Hernandez and the Online
Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This
book was produced from scanned images of public domain
material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
